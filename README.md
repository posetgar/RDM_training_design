#  RDM Training Design & Evaluation in Practice

This course corresponds to Module 4.2 in the [University of Vienna Data Steward Certificate Course.](https://rdm.univie.ac.at/data-stewards-at-the-university/become-a-data-steward/)

---

<h2>Course information</h2>

<h3>Course description</h3>
This session provides a practical introduction to designing and evaluating training in the domain of Research Data Management (RDM). It builds on the basic didactic concepts introduced in the previous session (4.1) and applies them through the design of an RDM training. In this follow-up session, the focus shifts from theory to practice. We will concentrate on actively thinking through how RDM training can be designed, adapted, and evaluated in your own context. Working in small groups, you will identify training needs, define the characteristics of your target audience, formulate learning objectives, and explore suitable learning activities.

By the end of the session, you will have taken the first steps toward developing an RDM training concept that is aligned with learner needs, supported by clear outcomes, and grounded in thoughtful instructional design.

During the session, the following topics will be addressed:

- Training example: mapping an RDM course delivered by Ghent University data stewards to the ABC learning design method  
- Overview of different RDM learning activities  
- Evaluating and adapting training: how to include evaluation in training and adapt according to feedback or delivery method  
- Hands-on work: getting started with the design of RDM training

<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of this session, students will be able to:</p>

<p>- Explain why investing time in training design is essential and describe the overall training lifecycle (from needs analysis to evaluation)</p>
<p>- Analyze the characteristics and needs of the target audience</p>
<p>- Identify and define the topics, learning objectives, and outcomes for the course</p>
<p>- Propose appropriate learning activities and learning types for the different course topics</p>
<p>- Sketch a plan to include assessment and feedback mechanisms for the course</p> 
<p>- Evaluate the effectiveness of the learning activities proposed by peers</p>
<p>- Process and incorporate feedback into their own training design or concept</p> 
<p>- Develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their own learning</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
This lesson includes short lectures and group discussion, as well as smaller group work tasks. It is an interactive session involving knowledge-sharing and discussion among learners.

<h3>Assignment</h3>
Individually designing a training concept using the template given (2-3 pages).
The details of the assignment will be discussed during the live session and uploaded to Moodle.
