<h3>Introduction</h3>
In the last two previous years, we asked participants of the module how much time they spent on different aspects of training design? These were the results:
Scale

- **1:** I do not spend any time on this aspect
- **2:** I spend **little** time on this aspect
- **3:** I spend a **moderate** amount of time on this aspect
- **4:** I spend **quite a lot** of time on this aspect
- **5:** I spend **most** of my time on this aspect

| Aspect                               | Average (2024–2025) |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------:|
| Analyzing training needs             |                 2.9 |
| Defining learning objectives/outcomes|                 2.7 |
| Defining the audience                |                 2.6 |
| **Creating content & learning activities** |               **4.3** |
| Designing assessment methods         |                 2.1 |
| Training evaluation                  |                 1.8 |

As you can see, most people spend most of their time in creating content, spend the least ammount of time in assessment and evaluation, and spend limited ammount of time in the training design phase.


<h3> Why spending time on training design? </h3>

Good training does not happen by accident. Investing time in training design ensures that the learning experience is purposeful, relevant, and effective. By consciously planning who the training is for, what it should achieve, and how it will be delivered, you create a structure that supports both the trainer and the learners.

<details>
  <summary><strong>1. Align training with real needs</strong></summary>

If you understand who your learners are and what they struggle with, you can tailor the training to what truly matters.

**Tip:** Instead of giving a generic RDM overview to postdocs, you focus on *GDPR in practice* and *repository selection* because that’s where they typically struggle.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>2. Define clear learning outcomes</strong></summary>

Clear outcomes help you decide what to include, what to skip, and how to check whether learning occurred.

**Tip:** Instead of “understand DMPs”, define: *“Learners can complete the data summary table for their own project.”* For policy sessions: *“Learners can identify which RDM and Open Science policies apply to their project.”*

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>3. Choose appropriate learning activities</strong></summary>

Spending time on designing makes you plan **how** learners will learn, not just **what** you will present. Learning activities become meaningful, because they support specific outcomes.

**Tip:** Rather than only presenting slides about file naming, use a short activity where they fix poorly named files. Instead of just showing a FAIR checklist, ask learners to compare datasets in repositories and discuss FAIRness.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>4. Increase engagement and motivation</strong></summary>

Good design keeps learners active rather than passive.

**Tip:** Break long webinars into short blocks of content, and include polls, quizzes, or breakout discussions. Let participants bring **their own RDM issues** and discuss them in small groups.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5. Make evaluation and improvement possible</strong></summary>

With clear goals and structure, it is easier to assess whether the training worked — and to adapt based on feedback or delivery mode.

**Tip:** Instead of collecting only an end‑of‑course survey, include assessment/feedback moments during the session than can help you evaluate specific activities. After each edition, document what to keep, drop, or change.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>6. Use time and resources efficiently</strong></summary>

Thoughtful design prevents overload, avoids unnecessary content, and focuses on what truly matters.

**Tip:** Rather than preparing an extensive slide deck covering all aspects of RDM, you may choose to focus on one key problem to work on (e.g. storage). You can also design reusable activities that can be adapted for future sessions.
